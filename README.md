The openedx-translations GitHub repo is mostly empty which makes translations testing a bit challenging.

The good news, is that we have translations in other projects that we can test.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The [openedx-translations](https://app.transifex.com/open-edx/openedx-translations/dashboard/) Transifex project has translations for all resources in the three following languages: fr_CA, ar, de .
- Those translations should be pulled from the other Open edX Transifex projects .
- Scripts, configurations are pushed into Zeit-Labs organization for later use
